ChangeLog and TODO list for lulzbuster
======================================

[ ] to be implemented
[.] in progress
[x] implemented
[-] canceled


===> 1.X.X

  [ ] update: count newlines, words and print them in stat line (smart mode)
  [ ] new feature: fuzz given placeholder in the URL with wordlist(s) (fuzzing)
  [ ] new feature: add regex/option to specify a custom 404-page
  [ ] update: double check (start must equal end) (smart mode)
  [ ] new feature: build statistics during scan and print them at the end
  [ ] new feature: recursive scan + exclude given directories
  [ ] new feature: save and restore session after 'ctrl+c'
  [ ] attack.c: attack(): collect hits table. if 200 was given with same size
      over X times -> claim false-positive (smart mode)
  [ ] http.c: do_req(): handle errors in a pragmatic way: count for X errors and
      then offer something to do as next or give up
  [ ] really, clean up and refactor the code a bit where necessary


===> 1.3.2

  [x] add sigaction() wrapper and signal handlers for later usage


===> 1.3.1

  [x] remove forgotten escape sequence char when loggin to file


===> 1.3.0

  [x] do wildcard check for any HTTP resp. code except 404
  [x] skip 0 bytes size files/dirs
  [x] remove count_lines() since not needed anymore


===> 1.2.0

  [x] update: clean-up lists/*.txt (removed words with spaces)
  [x] update: use libcurl's dns cache forever
  [-] make fast if '-f' option was used. (handle 301 codes correctly). we
      probably would need to fetch location header and build/set new url :s
  [x] update: add headline prior hit line
  [x] update: add response time to stat line
  [x] update: just for testing: let's get rid of pthread locks in attack.c for
              curl internals and see how it goes in future
  [x] update: get rid of count_lines() in misc.c (not needed since we count
              already # of lines in read_lines())
  [x] update: show also real size in bytes next to calculated size
  [x] bugfix: fix a stupid bug at fclose()
  [x] update: log also on stderr while '-l' was chosen
  [x] update: update default excluded http status codes to:
              400,404,500,501,502,503
  [x] update: make better LOG functions and define them clearly so we can use it
              everywhere at anytime and don't mix shit
  [x] bugfix: more fixes for wrong color codes
  [-] update: pack opts_T struct


===> 1.1.0

  [x] update: by default, turn off 'auto update referrer' of curl
  [x] update: count num http ex codes outside of attack.c
  [x] update: count num attack urls outside of attack.c
  [x] update: set max line length (1024 bytes) to read from wordlists
  [x] update: skip the curl-error checks in switch-case in do_req() for now,
      since we don't use it currently in pragmatic way anyway
  [x] update: use a few register variables
  [x] bugfix: fix wrong color reset code


===> 1.0.0

  [x] initial release
